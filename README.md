# MNIST
Neural network coded from scratch in numpy to identify characters frm the MNIST Dataset over 96% accuracy.
The inputs are initialized to a matrix 42000 by 784 matrix (28 by 28 images with each pixel) by and outputs a  10 by 1 matrix due to the last layer being a softmax layer it outputs the probabilities of each number. It learns using stochastic gradient descent.
